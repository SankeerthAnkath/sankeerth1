         <p>information, with thousands of disease support groups, clinical advice forums and<br>
            disease-specific information resources. According to Provost, Perri, Baujard, and Noyer<br>
            (2003), patients use the Internet to search for health and drug information, disease<br>
            description, medical literature, online medical consultation, and to seek second opinions<br>
            on a medical diagnosis. Health professionals on the other hand use the Internet to search<br>
            for information on drugs, medical literature and recommend Web sites and support<br>
            groups to patients (Provost et al., 2003). The Internet, can in addition, be seen as a<br>
            valuable aid to computer assisted learning. A multitude of resources exist, (for example,<br>
            Physicians Online) which can provide access to a wide range of valuable multimedia<br>
            learning resources.</p>
<p><b> Electronic Care Communications:</b> Electronic care communications, or healthcare ad-<br>
    ministration systems, provide the potential for the use of secure local and wide area<br>
            networks to speed up: scheduling appointments; referrals between healthcare profes-<br>
            sionals; communication of outcomes and discharge letters. The Internet can also be<br>
            useful to spread policies (Policies, Medical Practice Management) and can be used as<br>
            an assistance tool in the entry point in hospitals. For example, in Chonnam National<br>
            University Hospital of Korea (Korea Chonnam Hospital), an institution with about 4,000<br>
            patient visits per day, the Internet is used to manage all patient information.</p> 
<p><b> e-Prescribing:</b> e-Prescribing has been defined as the use of an automated data entry<br>
            system to generate a prescription (Krohn, 2003), however it is appreciated that in the<br>
            modern ICT based healthcare arena e-Prescribing refers to the use of both computing and<br>
            telecommunications technology to capture, store, print and often transmit prescription<br>
            data. Contemporary e-Prescription systems provide connectivity between general prac-<br>
            titioners, pharmacists and healthcare agencies enabling secure and accurate transmis-<br>
            sion of new and repeat prescriptions. At present, e-prescribing is being addressed at<br>
            national levels with many systems already operational (Middleton, 2000) and others<br>
            being piloted prior to uptake (Mundy & Chadwick, 2003)</p>
 <p><b>Delivery and Support of Direct Care: </b>The Internet has been comprehensively reported<br>
    to support many home-based care models (Beolchi, 2003) supporting aspects such as<br>
    medication management (Nugent, Finlay, & Black, 2001), vital signs assessment and<br>
    cardiac monitoring to name but a few. Internet-based home care can be an efficient cost-<br>
    effective means to reach distant groups of people. In Japan, where there are more than<br>
    200 islands with 80 of them having less than 300 people and 60 having no healthcare<br>
    clinics, Internet-based healthcare plays an important role in preventive medicine and<br>
    early diagnosis (Isechi, Oda, Shinkura, Akiba, Fujikawa, & Yamazaki, 2004).</p> 
<p><u><h3>Decision Support and the Internet</h3></u></p> 
<p>Many “intelligent” tools have made their way into medical applications. Indeed, medicine<br>
    has always been one of the most important and sought-after application areas of decision<br>
    support systems and artificial intelligence. Such systems have been helping healthcare<br>
    professionals for more than four decades with the first instance of usage of computers<br>
    in medicine considered to be the analysis of electrocardiogram data in the late 1950s<br>
    (Stallman & Pipberger, 1961). Computerized approaches to decision support can provide<br>
    intermediate patient assessments. In the most general case they are useful for the<br>
    analysis of complex and large amounts of data quickly. This results in repeatable<br>
    processing of clinical and patient data, and offers benefits of consistency and lower<br>
    levels of observer variability (Willems, Abreu-Lima, Arnaud, Van Bemmel, et al., 1988).<br>
    Successful approaches to medical decision support have varied from the application of<br>
    decision trees and expert systems (van Bemmel & Musen, 1997) to Neural Networks and<br>
    Genetic Programming.</p>      
<p>The establishment of Internet-based healthcare systems has produced a realm of<br>
    opportunities for the uptake and application of medical decision support systems. With<br>
    Internet-based healthcare intermediate automated decision support can now be facili-<br>
    tated. A problem associated with such an approach is the identification of the most<br>
    relevant information upon which to perform the analysis and the format of the resulting<br>
    output to be presented to the clinician/patient. The amount of information generated is<br>
    vast, in addition to its complexity and multi-faceted structure.</p>
<p>The element of time, associated with clinical information can be identified as an important<br>
    aspect in the delivery and automation of decision support that can be facilitated by<br>
    Internet-based healthcare delivery. It has recently been reported that the element of time<br>
    has not had its full potential exploited in terms of the benefits it can offer in medical<br>
    decision support systems (Augusto, 2003a). Although Internet-based systems and<br>
    medical decision support systems are slowly merging, consideration must also be given<br>
    to the tools required to analyze time related information and give consideration as to how<br>
    they can be incorporated into Internet-based healthcare delivery.</p> 
    <p><b><h3><u>The Benefit of Temporal Reasoning in<br>
        Remote Decision Support for Medicine</u></h3></b></p>  
 <p>We address here some general issues related to Temporal Reasoning (TR) which will be<br>
    associated with the application domain in the following sections. Firstly, we wish to<br>
    highlight the importance of TR in daily life. Although usually unconsciously, we need<br>
    to make considerations on a daily basis regarding the preferred order that some of our<br>
    activities have to be performed in, or for how long some of these activities will last.<br>
    Frequently deadlines have to be met, such as at work we are constantly undertaking<br>
    activities which have prescribed time limits, in our personal lives we engage in activities<br>
    that are constrained by time; to collect children from school or to reach the supermarket<br>
    before it closes. These activities sustain our perception of time ubiquity and provide a<br>
    clear practical motivation behind the research in TR.</p> 
 <p>The importance of addressing the way in which humans deal with time-related notions<br>
    was identified in the 1970s as an important goal to be addressed by the Artificial<br>
    Intelligence (AI) community as a step towards providing intelligent behavior from<br>
    computing systems. Now, TR is a well-established area of research within AI. Research<br>
    in the area has been steadily increasing over the past two decades and as a result much<br>
    understanding about the related problems has been gained and many techniques and<br>
    associated tools are now available.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of concepts to be considered when designing dynamic systems. An<br>
    elementary issue relates to the temporal references to be used (hours, minutes, calendar</p> 
 <p>Figure 3. Qualitative temporal relationships between durative and non-durative<br>
    temporal references (a) interval-interval case (b) point-point case (c) point-interval<br>
    case
    </p> 
    <img src="pages3.jpg" alt="">
<p>dates, etc.). Also, should the primitive occurrence of them be instantaneous (e.g., turning<br>
    a light on or off) or durative (e.g., keeping a light on for a period of time), or should both<br>
    be used? Some of the more basic temporal frameworks are based either on time points,<br>
    on intervals or on a combination of both. Figure 3 (a) depicts at an intuitive level, the<br>
    possible meaningful situations two intervals can be in. Part (b) shows the two meaningful<br>
    relative positions for two points, while part (c) shows the possible situations between<br>
    a point and an interval.</p> 
<p>Explicit details of how the aforementioned can be integrated in a TR system can be found<br>
    in Allen (1984) and Meiri (1991). Temporal references provide a way to directly represent<br>
    situations involving different types of sequential or concurrent time-related concepts<br>
    like states holding for a given period or events that can provoke a transition in the system<br>
    from one state to the next one. Specific research has been focused on repetitive patterns<br>
    that may be used to reason about processes (Cukierman & Delgrande, 2000).</p>
<p>The durative time references included in Figure 3 are called intervals and rely on precise<br>
    knowledge about their duration. However, it is usually the case that the knowledge<br>
    available is not as precise as desired, for example, it may be known when an event started<br>
    but not when it finished or vice versa; these are called semi-intervals (see Freksa, 1992).<br>
    If for example the end of an interval is not known then it may be important to infer when,<br>
    possibly within some boundaries, the point at which the semi-interval can be supposed<br>
    to persist to (see Sadri, 1987; Augusto 2003b).</p> 
<p>It is impossible to give here a full coverage of all the subtleties involved in TR. We have<br>
    introduced some basic concepts and invite the interested reader to review the following<br>
    to obtain a more complete picture of the subtleties, challenges and benefits involved in<br>
    using TR: Newton-Smith (1980); Shoham (1987); Sandewall (1994); Galton (1995) and<br>
    Augusto (2001).</p>   
<p><u><h3>Why Temporal Reasoning is Important in Medicine?</h3></u></p> 
<p>Reflecting the many possible instances of time-related information in medicine there has<br>
    been quite an intense research activity in the area during the last decade. See for example<br>
    some of the special issues focused on the topic: Keravnou (1991); Keravnou (1996);<br>
    Combi & Shahar (1997); Shahar & Combi (1999) and a more recent survey by Augusto<br>
    (2003a).</p>   
<p>A long list of general activities has been identified as key initial steps in the process to<br>
    provide explicit temporal awareness for systems related to medicine (Shahar, 1999). Some<br>
    of these activities are:</p> 
<p>a. Determining bounds for absolute occurrences, some information may be missing,<br>
    for example we know when some symptoms finished but not when they started.<br>
    Hence it is possible by using other information to infer, at least within some time<br>
    boundaries, the point in time at which the symptoms started.</p>
<p>b. Persistence derivation, if we know that some symptoms started to develop, how<br>
    long can we assume that they will last?</p>
<p> c. Inconsistency detection and clipping of uncertainty, in real life we know that there<br>
    are conditions which are mutually exclusive, for example, it is not possible to have<br>
    “high blood pressure” and “normal” blood pressure at the same time. However, we<br>
    may have information indicating a patient having high blood pressure from days<br>
    one to three and normal blood pressure from days five to eight; but we do not know<br>
    what the blood pressure was during day four. It may be equally plausible that the<br>
    persistence of the period of high blood pressure extends into day four as well as<br>
    the persistence into the past that the period of normal blood pressure may have<br>
    started on day four, leading to an inconsistency about what the system can actually<br>
    infer about day four. Gathering more information or applying extra inference<br>
    mechanisms can lead to the elimination of the ambiguity.</p>
<p>d. Deriving new occurrences from other occurrences, sometimes knowledge can be<br>
    inferred instead of gathered directly from the patient’s interview or medical records.<br>
    For example, if we are informed a patient has been taking specific medication and<br>
    it is known that this particular medication has known side effects.</p>
<p>e. Deriving temporal relations between occurrences, sometimes information about<br>
    which events have occurred is available but not in which order they occurred. It<br>
    is then important to have a means to disambiguate these qualitative relationships,<br>
    for example, if they were consecutive or concurrent, as they may play an important<br>
    role in the ensuing diagnosis. A headache followed by a stomachache may report<br>
    unrelated events but the headache may be a later consequence of the digestive<br>
    problem.</p>
<p>Shahar and Combi (1999) presented a range of sophisticated systems dealing with<br>
    various subtle topics addressing these integration issues. However, they also recog-<br>
    nized that these were only the first steps to tackle the formidable task of providing flexible<br>
    and rich integration between time representation and use in medicine. We share that view<br>
    and the purpose of this article is then to unravel further challenges which should be<br>
    addressed in order to obtain the next generation of intelligent assistants for medicine,<br>
    but in this case, focusing on distance-based decision support.</p>  
<p><u><h3>Why Temporal Reasoning is Important for<br>
    Internet-Based Medicine?</h3></u></p>
<p>There are many areas of Internet-based technology that can benefit from TR related<br>
    technologies. As a way of illustration consider the scenarios previously discussed:</p>
<p>• Information Provision (training of personnel and students). It is important for<br>
        medical staff undergoing training to be capable of identifying and distinguishing<br>
        different clinical contexts based on their evolution in time</p>
<p>• Electronic Care Communications (hospital management). The ideal scenario for<br>
    this application would be that the system is used to allocate resources in an efficient<br>
    </p>
<p>manner so that in transit or arriving patients can be directed to the correct places<br>
    for treatment and to ensure that all the resources required are available at the right<br>
    time</p>   
<p>• E-prescribing (medication management). Internet-based prescribing can bring<br>
    efficiency in the timely location and preparation of medication in response to the<br>
    demands of a patient’s medication prescription as issued by their Doctor.</p>
<p>• Delivery and support of direct care (online medical diagnosis system). One of the<br>
    challenges in this scenario is the replacement of in situ examinations as a way to<br>
    collect evidence about symptoms. It is, however, also important to provide a means<br>
    to replace oral questions about the development of the symptoms through time</p>
<p>Intelligent support in Internet-based medical assistance is a challenging area that<br>
    demands a synergistic multidisciplinary effort involving areas of research like human-<br>
    computer interaction, security, databases, and medical informatics. It also demands<br>
    further multidisciplinary interaction between those whose knowledge of time-oriented<br>
    systems will find in the area of medicine a challenging but highly rewarding field of<br>
    application. Researchers and practitioners from medical informatics, TR in AI, temporal<br>
    databases, active databases, real-time databases, visualization of dynamic systems, and<br>
    real-time systems should have some knowledge and experience to share in this fertile area.</p>
<p>Although we believe all the areas listed above are important we will exemplify how this<br>
    context will affect key aspects of the traditional interaction between the professional and<br>
    patient during effective diagnosis. More specifically, we highlight the importance of<br>
    handling time-related concepts in Internet-based medicine and how its use may affect the<br>
    accuracy of diagnosis. We have found that existing systems do not handle the richness<br>
    of time-related concepts during the diagnosis stage and the variety of temporal refer-<br>
    ences required. For example, some symptoms are described as occurring on a particular<br>
    day, like “The symptoms started last Monday”. Some of them are identified precisely<br>
    once the duration is known, for example, “He had fever for three days”. Sometimes the<br>
    duration is not precisely identifiable and there is some degree of uncertainty the system<br>
    should be able to handle, for example, “Started yesterday evening and stopped at some<br>
    point during the night”. It is important to recognize repetitive processes, for example, “He<br>
    has headaches each time that he goes to music class” and frequencies of occurrence, for<br>
    example, “He has been taking this medicine three times each day”. Rich calendric<br>
    references should be handled, like seasons, in order to discover potential causes of<br>
    disease, for example allergies. Here we consider why, where and when these issues are<br>
    important in the context of Internet-based medical assistance.</p> 
<p><u><h3>Interaction Shifts with Internet-Based Diagnosis</h3></u></p> 
<p>The use of the Internet as an intermediate level between health centers and patients<br>
    brings a shift in the interaction and the usual tasks involved. The interaction is no longer<br>
    a physical meeting but instead there is a media that may restrict, sometimes significantly,<br>
    what each person involved in the communication perceives from each other</p>  
<p>According to the degree of technology involved many traditional sources of information<br>
    may not be available. For example, the patient cannot be touched, visualization of the<br>
    patient’s body may be restricted, use of some technological advances like scanners,<br>
    radiographies, and ECGs may not be possible. Hence, making the most of what is available<br>
    will be vital.</p>    
<p>Here the interaction between (i) a rich interface that allows extraction of information from<br>
    the patient in terms of the symptoms and (ii) suitable algorithms that can relate a, most<br>
    possibly, incomplete description of symptoms to a meaningful subset of possible<br>
    scenarios, will be crucial for the effectiveness of such systems. The interface becomes<br>
    a critical part of the system. In a routine visit to a clinician, natural language, body<br>
    language and other usual means of communications between humans are available. With<br>
    Internet-based consultations we can consider some substitutes like video and sound but<br>
    some of them may or may not be available. There may be occasions when these media<br>
    would not be usable, for example, due to privacy issues. Until image, video and sound<br>
    are widely available at the level of quality required to replace a face to face clinical<br>
    examination we focus on the more basic and less sophisticated ways of collecting<br>
    information via dynamically generated web based forms that can be used as the base for<br>
    interaction either in synchronous or asynchronous communication between patient and<br>
    health professional.</p>  
<p>Other areas of computer science become relevant like Natural Language processing and<br>
    appropriate interfaces that are friendly enough for the patient while gathering as much<br>
    information for the clinicians as possible. At the diagnosis level different subtleties will<br>
    help to identify between a possible dangerous situation and a non-dangerous one or<br>
    between two diseases that may require very different treatment even when they share<br>
    similar symptoms, for example, flu and hepatitis. Being able to successfully detect the<br>
    described symptoms with pre-known patterns of disease will require mechanisms like: a)<br>
    disambiguating relative orders between events and descriptions, b) inferring possible<br>
    durations for them when they are not given explicitly, c) dealing with degrees of<br>
    uncertainty in terms of the temporal scope of a given set of events and conditions, d)<br>
    using the partial list obtained at any time during the interaction to assess which is the<br>
    most likely scenario which in turn will help to select which questions to ask next or which<br>
    information to gather in order to maximize efficiency during the diagnosis process.</p> 
<p>There are quite a few hypotheses that must be taken into account to supply the system<br>
    with extra information that is available or gathered by other means. One basic point is that<br>
    patients should have a history, the normal approach for storing time-related information<br>
    being temporal databases (Tansel, Clifford, Gadia, Jajodia, Segev, & Snodgrass, 1993;<br>
    Etzioni, Jajodia, & Sripada , 1998). Also, the system should be time sensitive in the sense<br>
    that each subsequent visit should provide a different context. For example, if the purpose<br>
    of the later visit is to incorporate further information about a previous description of<br>
    symptoms, the system should react accordingly and should present information differ-<br>
    ently and/or different information. Once all the symptoms have been entered and those<br>
    that are relevant to the hypothetical syndrome are identified, the system may advise on<br>
    how to monitor for their evolution in time.</p>
<p>The rules for diagnosis should be “time-aware” and the interface with the patient should<br>
    allow some way to clearly indicate key time-based references, for example, the frequency,<br>
    </p>    
<p>duration and proximity of symptoms. The inference engine should instantiate internally<br>
    these temporal references with patterns and use the time of occurrence as a reference<br>
    during the reasoning. A specific device can be used for daily monitoring so as to reduce<br>
    errors, but more sophisticated users or applications will demand a more sophisticated<br>
    interaction and description of events and conditions. For example, if a patient is trying<br>
    to describe symptoms to ascertain if they have a medical condition, the temporal distance<br>
    between their occurrence and the relative order of their occurrence can make a difference<br>
    in the final diagnosis. In an asynchronous context, patients may be monitored and the<br>
    system, based on the trends of the input data in time, may decide to take a cautionary<br>
    step of contacting a health professional</p>    
<p><ul><h3>Exemplar Scenarios of TR in Healthcare</h3></ul></p>   
<p>To detail further of how TR in Internet-based healthcare may be employed, the following<br>
    sections provide an overview of three potential candidates</p> 
<p><h4>Example 1: Use of TR in Smart Homes</h4></p> 
<p>Here we consider a living environment for a person who supports and promotes<br>
    independent living by including a number of technological solutions embedded into their<br>
    home environment. The information gathered from such technology can be monitored<br>
    remotely via an Internet-based control center and used to provide a means of interaction<br>
    in the home environment between the person and their surrounding environment. (A<br>
    more technical description of this scenario can be found in Augusto and Nugent, 2004.)<br>
    In the scenario shown in Figure 4, a person’s movements can be monitored via motion<br>
    sensors in each room. The key issue, in terms of analysis of the information generated<br>
    </p>
<p>Figure 4. Layout of apartment indicating embedded technology to support independent<br>
    living</p>  
    <img src="pages4.jpg" alt="">  <br>
<p>by the smart house and in determining if an abnormal situation has arisen, is to primarily<br>
    ascertain the current location of the person. Following this, the sequence of their events<br>
    can be monitored along with their interaction with domestic appliances. The house, as<br>
    shown, is equipped with emergency switches, smoke and temperature sensor/alarms,<br>
    medical vital signs devices, sensors to detect movement out of bed and sensors to detect<br>
    if taps have been turned on or off. A middleware software structure provides the<br>
    necessary interoperability solution for the devices to ensure different data transmission<br>
    formats and standards can communicate between the house and the control center.</p>
<p>The diversity of the types of information generated by the sensors provides a number<br>
    of dimensions related to the person’s activities; (i) their whereabouts (ii) their interactio<br>
    with appliances and (iii) the duration of these events. The key element to take into<br>
    consideration is that as the person moves around the house and interacts with the<br>
    domestic appliances, analysis of this information and how the system should react must<br>
    take into consideration the ordering of these events and the time duration between them.<br>
    Hence TR based rules may be modelled and used to discriminate between normal<br>
    conditions and potentially hazardous situations when an alarm condition should be<br>
    raised. Consideration of the types of support required from a person can lead to support<br>
    in four different ways:</p>  
<p>• Prevention of dangerous situations: The information gathered from the person’s<br>
    environment can be assessed and also take into consideration their previous<br>
    actions. The purpose is to provide an alarm when a person’s actions may lead to<br>
    a potentially hazardous situation.<br>
    • Comfort: This addresses the issues of the surrounding environment and changes<br>
    these by taking into consideration the person’s whereabouts and their actions, for<br>
    example, turning lights on or off as they move from different rooms, or adjusting<br>
    the temperature when it becomes too hot or too cold.<br>
    • Security: Rules may be generated to provide an element of security. For example,<br>
    rules can be generated to act accordingly if an intruder or unexpected visitor enters<br>
    into the house.<br>
    • Health: Information can be accessed from self-operated medical devices. It is often<br>
    necessary to monitor vital signs over a period of time e.g. monitoring of blood sugar<br>
    level. For example, if this has an abnormally low or high value for more than three<br>
    successive recordings then medical staff should be contacted.</p>
<p>The analysis of the information generated can be based on an Active Database (ADB)<br>
    framework, an approach commonly used in TR. ABD are strongly based on the concept<br>
    of ECA (Event-Condition-Action) rules. ECA rules have the following form:</p>
    <p><h4>ON event IF condition DO action</h4></p> 
<p>The ON clause assesses in a given system the series of events that take place. For<br>
    example, it is possible to detect an event defined as “a person being in bed at a given<br>
    period of time during the day for a long period of time.” According to these events they<br>
    </p>  
<p>may be matched against certain criteria (IF clause of the ECA rule). For example, the<br>
    criteria may be that according to their profile it is not normal to be in bed during this period.<br>
    The final component of the ECA rule is the DO clause. When an instance of the events<br>
    defined in the ON clause occurs, and given that the condition has been matched<br>
    according to the IF clause this will lead to the system acting accordingly such as the DO<br>
    clause. For example, a form of action/intervention must be taken to assess why the person<br>
    is still in bed. The following ECA rule schema informally represents this scenario:</p>  
<p><b>ON “person being in bed for a long period of time”<br>
    IF “not expected to be in bed during this period”<br>
    DO “contact relevant carer”</b></p> 
<p>Another example may be representation of a condition where the system knows a person<br>
    is in their house, but when the doorbell has been activated by a visitor, the person in the<br>
    house has not responded. This may be represented by the following ECA rule schema:</p>  
<p><b>ON “doorbell ringing and person not answering the call for a long time”<br>
    IF “person inside house and not known to have hearing problems”<br>
    DO “apply possible emergency plan”</b></p> 
<p>Here we have just provided schema rules. Notice that there are specific time-related<br>
    concepts that are embedded in these rules, like the expression “a long period of time” in<br>
    the first rule and the need to detect the temporal sequence between the doorbell ringing<br>
    and the person not reacting to it. These concepts are domain dependant and should be<br>
    further specified in a specific language that can be adequately interpreted by a computer,<br>
    for example Prolog. To see one example of such a language, including temporal references<br>
    like those depicted in Figure 3, and a specific application of the scenario described in this<br>
    section to smart homes for elderly care, we invite the reader to make reference to Augusto<br>
    and Nugent (2004)</p>  
<p>Through an ECA rule set specification it is possible to model the activities of the person<br>
    and based on different activities the system can interact and change their living<br>
    environment to promote independent living in a number of ways. The core element of<br>
    such an interactive system will be reliant on an ADB management system hosted by an<br>
    Internet-based server with capabilities to distinguish between normal situations and<br>
    abnormal situations where some form of human intervention is required to assist the<br>
    person.</p>                        
<p><u><h3>Example 2: Use of TR in Medication Management</h3></u></p> 
<p>Medication compliance indicates the precision with which a patient follows a medical<br>
    prescription. This is a relatively new research domain that is currently receiving much<br>
    attention (Farmer, 1999; Wertheimer & Santella, 2003). Non-compliance has a negative<br>
    impact on both the individual patient and the healthcare system and wider economy. The<br>
    impact is clear: if a patient has been prescribed correctly following diagnosis, non-<br>
    compliance becomes an important barrier in optimizing treatment</p> 
<p>To assist with the issue compliance aids have been devised, tested and employed.<br>
    Typically, compliance aids have been classified into three categories; pill holders<br>
    (Corlett, 1996), alarm-based aids (Szeto & Giles, 1997) and monitoring devices (Wertheimer<br>
    & Santella, 2003). The latter of these are the most elaborate and form part of an integrated<br>
    care model whereby the patient’s adherence to their medication regime can be monitored<br>
    remotely (e.g., via an Internet-based care model) and alarms issued in instances of non-<br>
    compliance as a means of reminder. These systems facilitate the collation of unlimited<br>
    information regarding the patient’s compliance and hence provide for the means of data<br>
    analysis. For example, for a given patient, analysis of their data may show that due to their<br>
    lifestyle they repeatedly miss their medication dosages on Friday afternoons and<br>
    Saturday nights. For a different patient, analysis may show that they have high levels<br>
    of non-compliance during periods at which they may be at work. The resultant informa-<br>
    tion can be used to readjust the medication regimen in instances of non-compliance. This<br>
    is a complex procedure and must take into consideration the patient’s ailment, their entire<br>
    medication regime and the impact that missing one medication may have on the remainder<br>
    of medications and the point in time when the medication must be taken, for example,<br>
    before meals.</p>
<p>Qualitative and quantitative TR (as previously outlined) may be employed in this<br>
    instance whereby a set of formal rules can be established and used to control the<br>
    underlying principles by which a patient’s medication regime must be altered to accom-<br>
    modate for instances of non-compliance. For example, a decision support system running<br>
    on the central Internet-based server monitoring patient’s compliance at home may have<br>
    the following (hypothetical) rule set:</p> 
<div class="Table"><p><b>Qualitative Rule Set to Manage Instances of Non-Compliance</b></p>
<p> +Warfarin must be taken each day at 5pm<br>
    +Brufen must be taken after meals<br>
    +Insulin must be taken when sugar levels drop below a predefined value<br>
    +Acepril must not be taken at the same time as potassium supplements</p></div> 
<p><u><h3>Example 3: Hospital Management of Bed Occupancy</h3></u></p>  
<p>The estimation of the length of stay of patients in hospitals is important for patient<br>
    treatment management, bed occupancy management and cost effectiveness measures.<br>
    Mathematical models have been produced as decision aids in this area (McClean, 1994)<br>
    and in addition many trauma scores can be used to give an indication of patient survival<br>
    probability (Boyd, Tolson, & Cope, 1987) and severity of trauma indices (Champion,<br>
    Copes, & Sacco, 1990). All of this information along with demographic details, treatment,<br>
    physical and mental scores can be taken into consideration and used as means upon<br>
    which to generate a time to event measure, that is, prediction of length of stay in hospital.<br>
    This is a complex and multi-factorial problem, but nevertheless one worthy of further<br>
    attention. Qualitative and quantitative TR techniques may be used as the basis to model<br>
    </p>           
<p>the time to event measures. These techniques can easily be integrated into a hospital<br>
    based administrative system operating on an intranet/Internet basis which collates<br>
    information from all in-patients and wards within a hospital environment, in addition to<br>
    having access to centralized patient information. It can thus accommodate for the<br>
    complex temporal nature of the problem through formalized approaches, for example</p>
<div class="Table1"><p><b>Quantitative TR Rule Set to Manage Bed Occupancy</b></p>
<p> +Vacant beds should be increased by 10% during vacation<br>
    periods, predicted flu epidemics etc. (months 5,6,7 and 11, 12)<br>
    +Movement of patients between beds/wards should only occur<br>
    between 12.00 and 13.00 or 17.00 and 18.00<br>
    +A patient cannot remain within a bed for more than 24 hours<br>
    following indications that discharge has been approved</p></div> 
<p><ul><u><h3>Future Trends</h3></u></ul></p>
<p>It is clear that the Internet will have a long-term role within healthcare applications. At<br>
    present its application and ability to improve upon current and existing healthcare<br>
    practices has shown its promise and already we are slowly witnessing its uptake. Many<br>
    of the drivers that will inevitably lead to success will come from governmental perspec-<br>
    tives. For example, in the United Kingdom the government has put at the forefront of its<br>
    healthcare organization agenda development and increased usage of Intranet and<br>
    Internet services (Tyrrell, 1999). Provision of access to clinical information via Internet-<br>
    based services allows not only access via common desktop PCs, but also through the<br>
    usage of mobile phones with Web browsers and personal digital assistants. Hence users<br>
    will no longer be geographically constrained and will be able to access information whilst<br>
    undertaking house calls or on a hospital ward. This concept is further extended through<br>
    the new and innovative research areas of Ambient Intelligence, Context-Aware Comput-<br>
    ing, User Profiling and Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (ERCIM News, 2001) where<br>
    networks and interoperable communication infrastructures, along with intelligent pro-<br>
    cessing of information gathered have evolved as the next generation of services which<br>
    could further support this area</p>       
<p>In general, the role of ICT within healthcare will change the way in which patients interact<br>
    with healthcare professionals and also the way in which healthcare professionals interact<br>
    with each other. It is not unreasonable to consider that patients may be able to access<br>
    information via the Internet in the future and self-diagnose based on their symptoms<br>
    (Tyrrell, 1999). In addition, the recent success of sensor and textile technologies,<br>
    wearable vital sign monitors and home based medical devices for self assessment make<br>
    self-recording a possibility and provide tangible clinical information to be used in self-<br>
    diagnosis. For this to become reality, regional and national networks of high standing<br>
    will have to be established to ensure the integrity of the information and processes to<br>
    which the patient may have access. From the healthcare professional’s point of view, the<br>
    Internet offers the future role of high quality information provision. This will provide<br>
    </p> 
<p>enhanced access to new and evolving techniques, medical conditions and online<br>
    learning capabilities. All of which will greater inform the healthcare professionals<br>
    resulting in an overall improved level in healthcare quality</p>       
<p>From a more general perspective, the Internet has the ability to connect, on a global scale<br>
    patients and healthcare professionals during consultation processes. For example, a<br>
    patient may request a diagnosis directly from any private based clinic in the world, or on<br>
    a “pay-per-use” basis, exploit the e-commerce nature of the Internet and decrease waiting<br>
    times for private examinations or treatments. Although these scenarios are not unrealistic<br>
    to consider, it must be appreciated that the term “the Internet” as a means to provide them<br>
    all is a large scale underestimation of the complexity of the underlying processes. A<br>
    multitude of components such as communication bandwidth, mobile communication<br>
    infrastructures, security, interoperability, transmission protocols, information exchange<br>
    standards, and decision support modules will all have a role to play. Considering the<br>
    latter, which has been the main thrust of the current work, establishes the need to further<br>
    improve upon existing approaches</p>
<p>It is envisaged that efforts will continue to provide solutions, from a TR perspective,<br>
    which can accommodate for the temporal nature of healthcare based information. Recent<br>
    studies (Shahar, 1999; Augusto, 2003a) have identified several key areas of TR to be<br>
    explored to provide more accurate and useful automated assistance in healthcare. Here<br>
    we have covered general aspects while more specific and technical coverage is given in<br>
    Augusto & Nugent (2004). Some of the tools and the information required for the medical<br>
    practice is shared between the traditional scenario and the Internet-based approach to<br>
    diagnosis as discussed above. However, this article attempts to illustrate that while TR<br>
    remains an important concept to be considered in Internet-based healthcare, the infra-<br>
    structure where it is applied and the interaction with this technology is substantially<br>
    different and will pose further unresolved challenges.</p>
<p><ul><u><h3>Conclusion</h3></u></ul></p> 
<p>It is evident that the way healthcare will be delivered in the future will involve the<br>
    utilization of ICT solutions, especially the Internet, to ensure a cost-effective means of<br>
    high quality of service. Coupled with this will be embedded automated medical decision<br>
    support systems offering the ability to analyze and interpret the plethora of clinical<br>
    information that can be acquired through such infrastructures and their data repositories.<br>
    This will inevitability result in both patients and healthcare professionals being pre-<br>
    sented more often with ICT healthcare solutions resulting in a change in the way they<br>
    interact.</p>  
<p>The role of TR has been established and proven from a computer science perspective and<br>
    has attained applied success in many domains, including the assistance in medical<br>
    diagnosis and treatment. The last decade has witnessed a fruitful interaction between the<br>
    areas of TR and medicine and significant advances were made in time-related diagnosis<br>
    and therapy support. However, these advances were made under a different knowledge<br>
    </p>     
<p>management paradigm and although we think they may provide a good starting point they<br>
    cannot be directly applied to Internet-based healthcare systems.<br>
    Given that there is a large “time” element associated with clinical information and the<br>
    opportunity to embed TR into the next generation of Internet-based healthcare, we<br>
    identify this as a potential prolific area for future developments and an opportunity to<br>
    identify “how” and “where” it can be applied. Specifically, it is our view that in the short<br>
    term TR will be a valuable asset in the provision of automated support during Internet-<br>
    based patient to healthcare professional consultations</p>
